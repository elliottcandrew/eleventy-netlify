### Knowledge of methods of critical reflection on the impact of technology on site/culture and formal aspects of design (nonpositivist approaches to technology and design)

The project engages critically with the impact of technology on site and culture as a core aspect of the investigative methodology and procedural outcomes. As part of this process I would like to investigate the relationship that the architect has to site, this is a relationship that is often anodyne and detached from reality once site surveys are complete and the site is no longer accessible. This disconnect might be especially severe when the site is as remote and inaccessible as the Atacama Desert, as such it becomes particularly interesting to consider how we continue to engage with the site through virtual methodologies.

### Knowledge of present understanding of the implications of technology and production in our society

The creation, communication and consumption of digital data is ubiquitous to modern society, a core aim of this project is to interrogate the relationship that our online experience through internet technology has with the analogue, physical world that we live in.


### Knowledge of present technological developments to be applied or inspired by, and to be implemented in architectural design

The use of LiDAR technology is already an established field within architecture although it is presently used purely for site surveying. I believe the application of LiDAR analysis and specifically pointcloud analysis to virtual datasets such as the depth information I have extracted from Google Streetview can help us to understand the overlapping physical and virtual realms of architecture.

### Knowledge of present artistic practices challenging our understanding of spatial design

The use of pointcloud technology for artistic expression is still an emerging field, a small number of researchers within architecture, geospatial studies and deep learning are currently using the technology as part of the process to analyse and generate impressions of the physical world.

### Skills in transforming the acquired knowledge into a set of design parameters for the purpose of formulating an architectural program

I plan on pushing this use case even further beyond the abstract understanding of virtual/physical data by generating 3D models at several scales: the landscape, the town, and the individual building. By overlapping 3D topology with google streetview data and manually altered imagery, I can create a virtual world that is augmented as result of my own personal process, in this way an analytic toolset is used to generate an aesthetic outcome.

### Knowledge of construction principles, from structure to envelope and light conditions

As part of the generative procedure I will use CFD and environmental analysis to output physical studies based on the 3D virtual environment. Simulations such as solar gain, wind vectors, sand deposition and erosion can all be run on the virtual environment and even compared to a control group of simulations based on the real physical world. Furthermore the outputs of these analyses can be used as the inputs for further simulations, creating an iterative loop of generative form finding. Methods for this could include regressive genetic modelling such as the Galapagos package in Grasshopper or collaborative/adversarial deep learning algorithms.
