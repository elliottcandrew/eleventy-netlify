### Excerpts

---

At the same time, modernity's engine of the future, namely technological development, continues at its accelerated pace ushering us into a world of information networks that function entirely according to principles of synchronicity while providing us with multiple images and narratives of the non-synchronous. The paradox is that we still harbor high-tech fantasies for the future, but the very organization of this high-tech world threatens to make categories like past and future, experience and expectation, memory and anticipation themselves obsolete. The jumble of the non-synchronous, the recognition of temporal difference in the real world thus clashes dramatically with the draining of time in the world of information and data banks. But the borders between real world and its construction in information systems are of course fluid and porous. The more we live with new technologies of communication and information cyber-space, the more our sense of temporality will be affected. Thus the waning of historical consciousness is itself a historically explainable phenomenon. The memory boom, however, is a potentially healthy sign of contestation: a contestation of the informational hyperspace and an expression of the basic human need to live in extended structures of temporality, however they may be organized. <mark>It is also a reaction formation of mortal bodies that want to hold on to their temporality against a media world spinning a cocoon of timeless claustrophobia and nightmarish phantasms and simulations.</mark> In that dystopian vision of a high-tech future, amnesia would no longer be part of the dialectic of memory and forgetting. It will be its radical other. It will have sealed the very forgetting of memory itself: nothing to remember, nothing to forget.^[p9]

As the acceleration of history and culture since the eighteenth century has made an increasing number of objects and phenomena, including art movements, obsolete at ever faster rates, the museum emerged as the paradigmatic institution that collects, salvages, and preserves that which has fallen to the ravages of modernization. But in doing so, it inevitably will construct the past in light of the discourses of the present and in terms of present-day interest. Fundamentally dialectical, the museum serves both as burial chamber of the past-with all that entails in terms of decay, erosion, forgetting-and as site of possible resurrections, however mediated and contaminated, in the eyes of the beholder. <mark>No matter how much the museum, consciously or unconsciously, produces and affirms the symbolic order, there is always a surplus of meaning that exceeds set ideological boundaries, opening spaces for reflection and counter-hegemonic memory.</mark>

This dialectical nature of the museum, which is inscribed into its very procedures of collecting and exhibiting, is missed by those who simply celebrate it as guarantor of unquestioned possessions, as bank vault of Western traditions and canons, as site of appreciative and unproblematic dialogue with other cultures or with the past. But neither is it fully recognized by those who attack the museum in Althusserian terms as ideological state apparatus whose effects are limited to serving ruling class needs of legitimation and domination. True enough, the museum has always had legitimizing functions and it still does. And if one looks at the origins and history of collections, one can go further and describe the museum from Napoleon to Hitler as a beneficiary of imperialist theft and nationalist self-aggrandizement. In the case of so-called natural history museums especially, the link between the collectors' salvage operation and the exercise of raw power, even genocide, is palpably there in the exhibits themselves: Madame Tussauds of otherness.^[p15]
