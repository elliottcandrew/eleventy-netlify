# Visualizing the virtual tourist experience

## Psychogeography

- Spatial memories
- Virtual vs physical
- "Authentic" experience through a digital portal

## Tourist Gaze

- Stepping out of reality/normality
- A definable, collective concensus of expectation - aesthetic, cultural, experiential
- Space as a disconnected and globalized resource

## Palimpsest

- Artefact vs replica
- Compression of past/present/future
- Flattening of cultural meaning, nuance, reality and artefice

## Dialectic space

- A platform for engagement, direct or indirect
- Space for the application of excess meaning
