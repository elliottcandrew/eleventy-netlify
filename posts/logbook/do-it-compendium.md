## A procedural instruction manual for endlessly generating artwork

Conceived by curator Hans Ulrich Obrist, do it is an exhibition of artists’ instructions, that began in Paris in 1993 with a discussion between Obrist and artists Christian Boltanski and Bertrand Lavier, who were curious to see how an exhibition may never stop. Now, do it has become the longest-running and most far-reaching exhibition ever, giving new meaning to the concept of the “exhibition in progress.” In 2013, ICI and Obrist partnered to create the 20th anniversary version of do it, with new artists’ contributions and a compendium of over 250 instructions.
