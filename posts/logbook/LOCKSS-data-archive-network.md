## About

Stanford Libraries and industry collaborators initially developed and deployed the LOCKSS technology for the distributed preservation of electronic scholarly publications. In the intervening two decades, the applications of LOCKSS networks have expanded to include all types of digital content and a growing community of organizations needing a reliable mechanism for long-term digital integrity assurance and access.^[[from LOCKSS website](https://www.lockss.org/)]
